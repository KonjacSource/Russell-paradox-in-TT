# Russell-paradox-in-TT

Might the easiest way to formalize Russell's paradox in Type Theory with type in type. Requires the use of sigma and identity types and UIP (This is not required if you are using extensional identity).

The formalization is so simple but I did not see it before, and it seems that some of people think that [Russell's paradox cannot be easily constructed, so we need Girard's paradox](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1962145/is-the-russell-paradox-formalizable-in-type-theories?newreg=b84c28ebab8a4da59706cd6989b24890).

See [here](https://konjacsource.github.io/assets/Russell_in_TT.pdf) for the note in pdf.

Note that this construction is not [Coquand's paradox of tree](https://1lab.dev/1Lab.Counterexamples.Russell.html).
